  - **Convert to Opportunity:** Always create the opportunity upon lead conversion. Skipping this to "keep your pipeline clean" actually breaks reporting and stalls the approval flow later.
  - **The Contract Signer:** Set the Contract Signer on the GPC Solution early—before it ever hits Approval Pending. Trying to append it at the 11th hour will block your DocuSign envelope.
  - **DocuSign prep:** Every single recipient on a DocuSign envelope must exist as a Contact on the account first. No exceptions.
  - **Closed Lost:** Never delete a Closed Lost record. That history is critical for forecasting and future re-engagement campaigns.

knowledge_checks:
  - question: "You are converting a warm lead, but they haven't given a firm verbal commitment yet. Do you create the Opportunity?"
    options:
      - "Yes. Always create the opportunity upon conversion so the system tracks the progression and approvals route correctly."
      - "No. Wait until they verbally commit so you don't clutter the team pipeline with 'maybes'."
      - "No. Just leave them as a Lead and set a reminder task for next week."
    correct_index: 0
    explanation: "Skipping the opportunity creation breaks the entire downstream reporting and approval chain. Convert and create."

  - question: "When is the correct time to assign the Contract Signer to the GPC Solution?"
    options:
      - "Early in the process, before the solution ever reaches Approval Pending."
      - "Right after the solution gets fully approved, just before you hit the Conga merge button."
      - "It doesn't matter, as long as it happens before the customer opens the email."
    correct_index: 0
    explanation: "If you wait until it is Approval Pending, the system locks and blocks your DocuSign envelope."

  - question: "You need the customer's CFO to sign the final agreement, but you've only been dealing with the IT Director. What must you do in Salesforce first?"
    options:
      - "Create the CFO as a Contact on the Account record before sending the DocuSign."
      - "Just type the CFO's email address manually into the DocuSign routing window."
      - "Send it to the IT Director and ask them to forward the DocuSign to the CFO."
    correct_index: 0
    explanation: "Every DocuSign recipient must be a formalized Contact on the Account. Period."

  - question: "A prospect just signed a 36-month deal with a competitor. What do you do with the Opportunity?"
    options:
      - "Mark it Closed Lost with the correct competitor reason. Never delete the record."
      - "Delete the record so leadership doesn't think you are hoarding dead pipeline."
      - "Revert the Opportunity back to a Lead so marketing can nurture them."
    correct_index: 0
    explanation: "Closed Lost history is highly valuable data. Deleting records destroys our competitive intelligence."

scenarios:
  - title: "The 11th Hour Signer"
    situation: |
      You fought hard for a deal, got the verbal 'yes', and pushed the GPC Solution all the way through approvals. You go to generate the DocuSign envelope and realize the CEO needs to sign, but you never added them to the Solution.
    choices:
      - label: "Quickly type the CEO's name into the DocuSign recipient list and hit send."
        feedback: "It will fail. The system requires the Contract Signer to be set on the GPC Solution before Approval Pending, and they must be a Contact. You now have to backtrack."

      - label: "Pull the Solution back, add the CEO as a Contact, set them as the Contract Signer, and re-route."
        feedback: "Correct, unfortunately. Next time, establish the signer early to avoid stalling your own deal at the finish line."

## Overview

<!--
### System of record

Salesforce is GPC’s **system of record for every deal**—from first contact to installed revenue. Keep live opportunities and activity **in Salesforce**, not in email or spreadsheets alone.

### 2026 onboarding (Sales Support)

Work the **Coffee Summary** stepper and the **training blocks on this page** in order—the same sequence Sales Support uses (**101** → **Check In 1** → **GPC Solution** → **multi-site**). Don’t skip ahead unless leadership documents an exception.

- **Check In 1:** 15 minutes with Sales Support and **Fritz Antoine** (Salesforce administrator), then **Amy** walks **live lead conversion**. Skim the job aid first: [Converting Leads — quick reference (PDF)](https://gpcom.sharepoint.com/sites/SalesforceRoadmap/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FSalesforceRoadmap%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F2025%20Salesforce%20Training%20Guides%20%28Legacy%20BAU%20org%29%2FConverting%20Leads%20to%20an%20Opportunity%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide%20%2D%201123%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FSalesforceRoadmap%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F2025%20Salesforce%20Training%20Guides%20%28Legacy%20BAU%20org%29).
- **Sign-in:** **Okta** for the Salesforce app (YubiKey no longer applies here).
- **Admin contact:** **Fritz Antoine** — [salesforceadministrator@gpcom.com](mailto:salesforceadministrator@gpcom.com).
- **Written guides:** **Process Deep Dive** (below) links PDFs and job aids; the **Salesforce Roadmap** library is in **Module Reference Files**.

### Happy path

1. **Lead conversion** — When you’re ready to quote, convert the lead. **Default: create the opportunity** (exceptions need manager or admin approval).
2. **Deal motion** — **GPC Solution** → **approvals** → **Conga** → **DocuSign**.

### Why the rules matter

Cutting corners—**no opportunity** on conversion, deleting **Closed/Lost**, a late **Contract Signer**, or signers that only live in a spreadsheet—breaks **approvals**, **billing**, and **commissions**. Clean data in, clean revenue out.

## Key Guidelines

1. **Always search first:** Duplicates cause ownership disputes and data quality problems. Search Salesforce before converting a lead.
2. **Convert to Opportunity:** The default is always to create an opportunity upon conversion. Exceptions require manager or admin approval.
3. **Accurate Pipeline Stages:** Stage, amount, and close date should move together and reflect reality you'd defend to leadership. Inflated stages distort the forecast.
4. **Set Contract Signer early:** Missing signers block DocuSign. Set the Contract Signer when you create the GPC Solution, well before it reaches Approval Pending.
5. **Contacts must exist in Salesforce:** DocuSign recipients must be Contacts on the account before sending. You cannot send an envelope to an email address that isn't attached to a Contact record.

## Common Pitfalls

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">

::: flip ["I'll skip creating the opportunity on conversion—less work."]
Default is always create the opportunity. Exceptions require manager or admin approval. Skipping on your own causes reporting gaps and approval issues.
:::

::: flip ["I deleted the Closed/Lost record to clean up my pipeline."]
Never delete Closed/Lost opportunities. The history matters for forecasting, win/loss analysis, and potential re-engagement.
:::

::: flip ["I'll add the Contract Signer right before I send to DocuSign."]
Set Contract Signer when you create the GPC Solution or early in its lifecycle. Adding it during Approval Pending behaves differently and can block the envelope.
:::

::: flip ["My signers are saved in a spreadsheet—I'll add them to Salesforce later."]
DocuSign recipients must be Contacts on the account before sending. Contacts not in Salesforce = envelope can't be sent.
:::

::: flip ["Close date is flexible—stage and amount are what matter."]
Stage, amount, and close date should move together and reflect a forecast you'd defend. Stale dates break leadership views and downstream planning.
:::

::: flip ["I'll run my follow-ups from notes—I'll update Salesforce when the deal heats up."]
Tasks, list views, and Home dashboards are the hygiene habit—if activity isn't on the record, handoffs and approvals break for everyone who touches the deal after you.

## Process Deep Dive [deep]

<!--
**Lifecycle flow:**
1. **Leads** → Convert when ready to quote. Default: creates account + contact + new opportunity. Exception (skip opportunity): manager or admin only.
2. **Opportunity:** stages, value, next steps. Closed/Won → projects per site. Closed/Lost → capture why; do not delete.
3. **Referral programs:** after conversion, referral fields accurate + referrer informed on status and eligibility.
4. **GPC Solution / CPQ:** Sites/lines complete before approval; Contract Signer early; DocuSign recipients = Contacts.
5. **Conga → Send to DocuSign:** only when process allows—not a substitute for approvals/Legal. Terms changes → Legal.

**Salesforce hygiene habits:**
- **Daily:** Tasks you'll do; pinned views; contacts on right account; Home dashboards fresh; Universal Search
- **Forecast:** Commit what you'd defend; stage + amount + close date move together; note risks on the record
- **GPC Solution:** complete before approval; Contract Signer set early; all recipients are Contacts

**DocuSign from Salesforce:**
- Set Contract Signer early (not in Approval Pending)
- Conga → Send to DocuSign; recipients = Contacts
- First-time DocuSign auth may be required
- Terms changes → Legal before sending

**After Closed/Won:** a project is created for each Solution Site. Complete sites/products/contacts at Closed/Won; Tasks + clear activity notes; referral fields still accurate.

**Avoid:** converting without opportunity (normal deals); duplicate contacts; stale close dates; incomplete GPC Solutions for approval; Contract Signer blank until Approval Pending; deleting Closed/Lost; signers not Contacts; spreadsheet-only pipeline.
